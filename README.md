# 🌿 Urban Green Incentives Platform

Welcome to a revolutionary Web3 platform that empowers urban residents to participate in green initiatives, like installing rooftop solar panels, to collectively reduce city-wide carbon emissions! Built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts, this project provides transparent, decentralized incentives through tokens and verifiable contributions, helping cities meet sustainability goals while rewarding eco-friendly actions.

## ✨ Features

🌱 Register and verify participation in green initiatives (e.g., solar installations, urban gardening, EV charging setups)  
💰 Earn reward tokens based on verified contributions to emission reductions  
📊 Track city-wide progress toward emission targets with immutable on-chain data  
🗳️ DAO governance for proposing and voting on new initiatives or reward adjustments  
🔄 Trade or stake green credits (NFTs) for additional benefits  
📈 Oracle integration for real-world verification of actions (e.g., energy production data)  
🚀 Scalable system with 8 interconnected smart contracts for security and modularity  
🌍 Contribute to global sustainability by aligning personal actions with municipal goals

## 🛠 How It Works

This platform uses a suite of Clarity smart contracts to handle everything from user registration to reward distribution. Participants install green tech (like rooftop solar), submit proof, and get rewarded if it contributes to city emission reductions. Cities or organizations can fund the reward pool, and the blockchain ensures transparency.

**For Participants (Urban Residents)**  
- Register your profile and initiative (e.g., "Rooftop Solar Installation").  
- Submit verifiable data (e.g., energy output via oracle).  
- Earn GREEN tokens proportional to your emission savings.  
- Stake tokens or mint NFTs to boost rewards or participate in governance.  

**For Verifiers and Oracles**  
- Use the oracle contract to feed real-world data (e.g., API from solar meters).  
- Call verification functions to confirm contributions against city baselines.  

**For City Administrators or Funders**  
- Fund the reward pool and set emission goals.  
- Monitor progress via dashboards querying on-chain data.  
- Propose new initiatives through the DAO for community voting.  

**For Everyone**  
- View leaderboards, trade NFTs on a marketplace, or stake for passive rewards.  
- All actions are immutable, preventing fraud and ensuring fair distribution.

## 📜 Smart Contracts Overview

The platform is powered by 8 Clarity smart contracts, each handling a specific aspect for modularity and security:

1. **UserRegistry.clar**: Manages user profiles, registrations, and basic KYC-like verification to prevent sybil attacks.  
2. **InitiativeRegistry.clar**: Stores details of approved green initiatives (e.g., rooftop solar specs, expected emission reductions).  
3. **GreenToken.clar**: SIP-010 compliant fungible token for rewards (GREEN tokens), with minting logic tied to verified contributions.  
4. **EmissionTracker.clar**: Tracks city-wide emission goals, baselines, and cumulative reductions from all participants.  
5. **VerificationOracle.clar**: Integrates off-chain data (e.g., solar energy production) and verifies against initiative requirements.  
6. **RewardDistributor.clar**: Calculates and distributes tokens based on verified data and emission impact.  
7. **GreenNFT.clar**: Mints NFTs as certificates for completed initiatives, which can be staked or traded.  
8. **GovernanceDAO.clar**: Handles proposals, voting (using staked GREEN tokens), and updates to parameters like reward rates.

These contracts interact seamlessly—for example, the RewardDistributor calls the VerificationOracle to confirm data before minting tokens from GreenToken.

Get started by deploying these contracts on Stacks testnet, connecting a wallet, and registering your first green initiative. Let's green our cities, one block at a time! 🚀
